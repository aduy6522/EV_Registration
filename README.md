# Event Registration Test Automation

## Overview

This repository contains an automated test case built with Cypress, a powerful testing framework for web applications. The test case verifies the functionality of the Event Registration feature on a web application.

## Test Case Description

The test case performs the following actions:

- Visits the Event Registration page of the web application.
- Fills out the registration form with randomly generated data.
- Submits the form and verifies the successful completion of the registration.
- Signs out from the application.

## Purpose

The purpose of this automation test case is to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the Event Registration feature on the web application. By automating the testing process, we can efficiently detect any issues or regressions introduced during development or updates to the application.
